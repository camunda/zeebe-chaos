The query API seem to handle this transparently, but changing the resulting data. Having the replicas set will cause some performance impact, as the ELS node might run into CPU throttling (as they have much more to do). ELS slowing down has an impact on processing as well due to our write throttling mechanics. This means we need to be careful with this setting, while it gives us better availability (CamundaExporter can continue when ELS nodes restart), it might come with some cost."]})]})}function u(e={}){const{wrapper:t}={...(0,s.R)(),...e.components};return t?(0,i.jsx)(t,{...e,children:(0,i.jsx)(h,{...e})}):h(e)}},28453:(e,t,a)=>{a.d(t,{R:()=>r,x:()=>o});var n=a(96540);const i={},s=n.createContext(i);function r(e){const t=n.useContext(s);return n.useMemo((function(){return"function"==typeof e?e(t):{...t,...e}}),[t,e])}function o(e){let t;return t=e.disableParentContext?"function"==typeof e.components?e.components(i):e.components||i:r(e.components),n.createElement(s.Provider,{value:t},e.children)}},41508:e=>{e.exports=JSON.parse('{"permalink":"/zeebe-chaos/2025/08/26/Resiliency-against-ELS-unavailability","editUrl":"https://github.com/camunda/zeebe-chaos/blob/master/chaos-days/blog/2025-08-26-Resiliency-against-ELS-unavailability/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2025-08-26-Resiliency-against-ELS-unavailability/index.md","title":"Resiliency against ELS unavailability","description":"Due to recent initiatives and architecture changes, we coupled us even more against the secondary storage (often Elasticsearch, but can also be OpenSearch or in the future RDBMS).","date":"2025-08-26T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"availability","permalink":"/zeebe-chaos/tags/availability"}],"readingTime":8.795,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Christopher Kujawa","title":"Chaos Engineer @ Zeebe","url":"https://github.com/ChrisKujawa","page":{"permalink":"/zeebe-chaos/authors/zell"},"imageURL":"https://github.com/ChrisKujawa.png","key":"zell"}],"frontMatter":{"layout":"posts","title":"Resiliency against ELS unavailability","date":"2025-08-26T00:00:00.000Z","categories":["chaos_experiment","bpmn"],"tags":["availability"],"authors":"zell"},"unlisted":false,"nextItem":{"title":"Dynamic Scaling: probing linear scalability","permalink":"/zeebe-chaos/2025/07/11/linear-dynamic-scaling"}}')}}]);
